# Coding_Sample
This R coding sample uses microdata from the Small Business Administration to analyze the distribution of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) dollars across Chicago. According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), as of 2019, 99.9% of all businesses in the U.S. were small businesses. Small businesses accounted for roughly 47.3% of the nation's labor force with 59.9 million employees (2019 Small Business Profile, sba.gov, 2019, https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142719/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-US.pdf). The Paycheck Protection Program was established in the CARES Act to provide small businesses with SBA-backed forgivable loans to cover operating costs through the duration of the COVID-19 crisis. The program's goal was to ensure small businesses had enough money to cover their costs until the COVID-19 crisis passed. In other words, enough money to pay their employees, cover rent and other business-related costs.<br/>
<br/>This sample seeks to explain where PPP dollars went in Chicago, who benefited from those dollars, when those dollars were received, and what communities were denied funding from this program.<br/>
<br/>In March of 2021, the SBA published the PPP microdata here: https://data.sba.gov/dataset/ppp-foia
